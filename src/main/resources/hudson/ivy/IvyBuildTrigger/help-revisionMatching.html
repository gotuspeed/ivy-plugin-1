<div>
    Select this checkbox if you want to allow the optional <i>branch</i> and <i>revision</i> attributes
    of the ivy.xml module descriptor to help calculate and filter the Hudson project dependency graph.
    Leaving this option unchecked means that only the mandatory <i>organisation</i> and <i>module</i> 
    attributes will be used when matching against the project ivy module descriptors.  However it also means
    that if you have two or more projects configured in Hudson using the same mandatory attribute
    values in their module descriptors, and another project defines a dynamic revision dependency on one of the
    modules, then all of the projects will match and will be considered upstream dependencies.  This is usually
    <b>not</b> what you want if you are using Hudson CI to build different versions (or different
    source code branches) of the same module at the same time, and selecting this checkbox can help
    avoid this problem.
